Plan environments for multiple teams

</PageDescription>

While separate development teams can each have a separate <Globals name="env" />, how many environments does a set of teams need? There are two approaches.

**Environment per team**: As described in [Environment Architecture](/arch/environment), each development team gets its own <Globals name="env" />. This approach has several consequences:
- Each team's environment is built of independent resources that can be managed and even billed separately
- Each team can customize the size of its environment, its backend services, and its CI/CD tools
- For teams in different geographies, each team's environment can be located in the IBM Cloud region closest to the team's geography
- If the client paying for the application's development wants the development environment located in the client's geography, the environment can be installed in the region in that geography
- Several small development teams will each require its own environment, which can lead to higher expense for envrionments with low utilization

**Shared environment**: An alternative approach is for multiple development teams to share a single <Globals name="env" />. This approach has several consequences:
- Resources are shared, including their cost and management duties
- Shared resources tend to be more highly utilized, although resource contention will occur between the teams
- Teams can more easily coordinate on applications and microservices that must work together in production
- Teams must share a single set of CI/CD tools and pipeline configurations that can be managed by a single adminstration team
- Teams share a single *test* namespace and *staging* namespace, and must coordinate accordingly

Teams that do not wish to use the same CI/CD tools or otherwise want to avoid having to coordinate with each other should use separate development environments. Teams that want to economize, share a set of CI/CD tools, and need to coordinate on application development may find a shared environment easier to use.

To create a shared environment, first install a single environment. Then create a *dev* namespace for each team, such as *dev-team1*, *dev-team2*, etc. (The original *dev* namespace can be renamed for the first team, *dev-team1*.) The multiple developer namespaces all share a single *tools* namespace and the CI/CD tools installed in it. They all use Argo CD--one of the Developer Tools--to deploy to shared *test* and *staging* namespaces. Use [Kubernetes RBAC](/getting-started-day-0) to control which developers can access which dev namespaces.
